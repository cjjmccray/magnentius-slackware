Install log

Slackware 14.1 (64-bit) installed.  I did try Ubuntu 14.10 first from DVD using a USB-connected DVD drive and though it did boot to a Ubuntu screen and give the impression it was loading stuff off the disk, after 90 minutes or more, it still hadn't moved on from the opening screen with 4 animated 'lights' under the word 'Ubuntu', hence I switched to Slackware 14.1.  Install time approximately 2 hours (not really noted properly) using a normal full install from the DVD.
Graphic login enabled (change runlevel on boot from 3 to 4 - can't remember exactly where).
Also change order in which window managers are tried - default puts KDE ahead of XFCE, and nice as KDE is, it's a bit of a CPU hog.

installpkg npapi-vlc-20150227-x86_64-1alien.txz

Flash player installed from: http://www.slackware.com/~alien/slackbuilds/flashplayer-plugin/pkg64/14.1/

XScreenSaver 5.29 (current version 5.22 from 2013 and bleats about being out of date)
64-bit version from here: http://slackware.cs.utah.edu/pub/slackware/slackware64-14.1/source/xap/xscreensaver/
is still 5.22.  Get hold of 5.29 (or later) from the 32-bit distro:
http://slackware.cs.utah.edu/pub/slackware/slackware-current/source/xap/xscreensaver/
then set xscreensaver.SlackBuild executable and run it - it will compile for a 64-bit environment.
There is also a 64-bit source here:
http://slackware.cs.utah.edu/pub/slackware/slackware64-current/source/xap/xscreensaver/
though they are identical (checked through md5sum).
Install using: upgradepkg xscreensaver-5.29-x86_64-2.txz (and rescue the .txz file from /tmp)

R - from SlackBuild: http://slackbuilds.org/repository/14.1/academic/R/


08-Mar-2015 2130h-2355h (it took this long to compile all the pieces, especially R-Studio)
R-Studio
has dependencies:
JDK: http://slackbuilds.org/repository/14.1/development/jdk/ & http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk8-downloads-2133151.html
and you've got to get JAVA_HOME set (will be rebooting to see if that fixes it)
apache-ant: http://slackbuilds.org/repository/14.1/development/apache-ant/
R-Studio Desktop: http://slackbuilds.org/repository/14.1/development/rstudio-desktop/

get_iplayer: http://www.infradead.org/get_iplayer/html/get_iplayer.html & sources: ftp://ftp.infradead.org/pub/get_iplayer/
and from SlackBuild: http://slackbuilds.org/repository/14.1/multimedia/get_iplayer/
You need to run: cpan HTML::Entities
(hinted from here: http://forum.vectorlinux.com/index.php?topic=10046.0)
and let CPAN set itself up using loads of defaults.
Then run:
cpan HTTP::Cookies
cpan LWP::ConnCache
and don't forget rtmpdump and ffmpeg - downloaded as 14.1 64-bit packages from:
http://slackware.org.uk/slacky/slackware64-14.1/multimedia/rtmpdump/2.3/
http://www.slackware.com/~alien/slackbuilds/ffmpeg/pkg64/14.1/
and for good measure I installed LAME:
http://www.linuxfromscratch.org/blfs/view/svn/multimedia/lame.html

rdesktop: http://www.rdesktop.org/
Compiled from scratch, with dependencies installed from SlackBuilds:

libgssglue:
http://canich.net/slackware/repo/13.37/l/slackbuilds/libgssglue/
http://pkgs.fedoraproject.org/repo/pkgs/libgssglue/libgssglue-0.1.tar.gz/ce1b4c758e6de01b712d154c5c97e540/

pcsc-lite:
http://mirrors.nix.org.ua/linux/slackware-misc/slacky.eu/slackware64-14.0/system/pcsc-lite/1.8.7/

pcsc-tools:
http://slackware.org.uk/slacky/slackware64-13.37/system/pcsc-tools/1.4.17/
http://pkgs.fedoraproject.org/repo/pkgs/pcsc-tools/pcsc-tools-1.4.17.tar.gz/2767238e1e737f94d13a91bdab1174ca/

and it does connect to a home Windows XP box:
rdesktop -u <user> -p <password> 192.168.1.29:3389
make sure you run this as a regular user and not while su root - it fails with error:
No protocol specified
ERROR: Failed to open display: :0.0
when run as root!

CUPS
- set /etc/rc.d/rc.cups executable and start it (both su root)
Brother HL2250DN driver
- download the .deb file, extract using Ark (not sure how to do this at the terminal)
- http://support.brother.com/g/s/id/linux/en/before.html?c=eu_ot&lang=en&prod=hl2250dn_eu_as&redirect=on#004
- extract the tar-balls
- go hunt for the .ppd file
Problem... causes an internal server error
- which I think is due to the PPD being a 32-bit app and Slackware out of the box is 64-bit only
- so install the 32-bit compat layer... with superb instructions from Alien Bob

HP LaserJet 4050 printer - from CUPS/standard Slackware interface and prints OK.  Odd issue printing from Kate/KWrite - the margins are set slightly outside the printer's capability, so you lose part of the text on all sides.  Not tried with Calligra (yet).
