Slackware 14.1 (64-bit) installed.  I did try Ubuntu 14.10 first from DVD using a USB-connected DVD drive and though it did boot to a Ubuntu screen and give the impression it was loading stuff off the disk, after 90 minutes or more, it still hadn't moved on from the opening screen with 4 animated 'lights' under the word 'Ubuntu', hence I switched to Slackware 14.1.  Install time approximately 2 hours (not really noted properly) using a normal full install from the DVD.

XScreenSaver 5.29 (current version 5.22 from 2013 and bleats about being out of date)
64-bit version from here: http://slackware.cs.utah.edu/pub/slackware/slackware64-14.1/source/xap/xscreensaver/
is still 5.22.  Get hold of 5.29 (or later) from the 32-bit distro:
http://slackware.cs.utah.edu/pub/slackware/slackware-current/source/xap/xscreensaver/
then set xscreensaver.SlackBuild executable and run it - it will compile for a 64-bit environment.
There is also a 64-bit source here:
http://slackware.cs.utah.edu/pub/slackware/slackware64-current/source/xap/xscreensaver/
though they are identical (checked through md5sum).
Install using: upgradepkg xscreensaver-5.29-x86_64-2.txz (and rescue the .txz file from /tmp)
