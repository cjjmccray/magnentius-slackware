Install log

Slackware 14.1 (64-bit) installed.  I did try Ubuntu 14.10 first from DVD using a USB-connected DVD drive and though it did boot to a Ubuntu screen and give the impression it was loading stuff off the disk, after 90 minutes or more, it still hadn't moved on from the opening screen with 4 animated 'lights' under the word 'Ubuntu', hence I switched to Slackware 14.1.  Install time approximately 2 hours (not really noted properly) using a normal full install from the DVD.
